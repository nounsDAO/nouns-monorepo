# teller-auction-monorepo

Teller Auction DAO is a decentralized lending collective run by a group of degens.


## Tri-Crypto 

More complex => we give them the option 
The user is forced to put their ETH into tri-crypto

Buy the Noun with ETH.  Can borrow that ETH but you have to pay interest on it.   Can borrow out in ETH/bitcoin/tether . 


User is paying back interest or they would default and lose the Noun (liquidate)
