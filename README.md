## Contributing

If you're interested in contributing to Nouns DAO repos we're excited to have you. Please discuss any changes in `#developers` in [discord.gg/nouns](https://discord.gg/nouns) prior to contributing to reduce duplication of effort and in case there is any prior art that may be useful to you.
