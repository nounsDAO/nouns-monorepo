              Nouns are an experimental attempt to improve the formation of on-chain avatar
              communities. While projects such as {cryptopunksLink} have attempted to bootstrap
              digital community and identity, Nouns attempt to bootstrap identity, community,
              governance, and a treasury that can be used by the community

                Nouns DAO utilizes a fork of {compoundGovLink} and is the main governing body of the
                Nouns ecosystem. The Nouns DAO treasury receives 100% of ETH proceeds from daily
                Noun auctions. Each Noun is an irrevocable member of Nouns DAO and entitled to one
                vote in all governance matters. Noun votes are non-transferable (if you sell your
                Noun the vote goes with it) but delegatable, which means you can assign your vote to
                someone else as long as you own your Noun.

                  obviously harmful governance proposal has been passed, and is intended as a last

                  Nouns are stored directly on Ethereum and do not utilize pointers to other
                  networks such as IPFS. This is possible because Noun parts are compressed and
                  stored on-chain using a custom run-length encoding (RLE), which is a form of
                  lossless compression.

                <Trans>
                  The compressed parts are efficiently converted into a single base64 encoded SVG
                  image on-chain. To accomplish this, each part is decoded into an intermediate
                  format before being converted into a series of SVG rects using batched, on-chain
                  string concatenation. Once the entire SVG has been generated, it is base64
                  encoded.

                  The Noun Seeder contract is used to determine Noun traits during the minting
                  process. The seeder contract can be replaced to allow for future trait generation
                  algorithm upgrades. Additionally, it can be locked by the Nouns DAO to prevent any
                  future updates. Currently, Noun traits are determined using pseudo-random number
                  generation:

              </p>

                  Trait generation is not truly random. Traits can be predicted when minting a Noun
