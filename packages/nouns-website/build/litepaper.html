    <h1>Nouns</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Nouns are an experimental attempt to improve the formation of on-chain avatar communities. While projects such as Cryptopunks have attempted to bootstrap digital community and identity, Nouns attempt to bootstrap identity, community, governance and a treasury that can be used by the community for the creation of long-term value. Additionally, nouns attempt to significantly slow community formation to ensure equal community growth over time and to incentivize the participation of long-term thinking.</p>
    
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>

      <li class='head'>1 noun trustlessly auctioned every 24 hours, forever</li>
      <li class='sub-head'>settlement of one auction kicks off the next</li>

      <li class='head'>All nouns are members of nounsDAO</li>
      <li class='sub-head'>nounsDAO uses a fork of Compound Governance</li>

      <li class='head'>1 noun = 1 vote</li>
      <li class='sub-head'>votes are delegatable, but non-transferable</li>

      <li class='head'>100% of noun auction proceeds are trustlessly sent to nounsDAO treasury</li>
      <li class='sub-head'>Treasury is controlled by Compound Governance framework</li>

      <li class='head'>Artwork is generative, on-chain</li>
      <li class='sub-head'>On-chain source of randomness, artwork lives on Ethereum (not IPFS)</li>

      <li class='head'>200 different noun bodies, ~150 shirts and accessories, ~50 glasses</li>
      <li class='sub-head'>no explicit rules for attribute scarcity, all nouns are equally rare</li>

      <li class='head'>Avatar artwork is public domain</li>
      <li class='sub-head'>No caveats, use it for whatever</li>

      <li class='head'>Project creators (‘nounders’) receive rewards in the form of nouns</li>
      <li class='sub-head'>additional nouns are minted concurrent with daily auctions, rewards decrease to 0 over time</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Daily Auctions</h2>
    <p>The nouns auction contract will act as a self-sufficient noun generation and distribution mechanism, auctioning one noun per 24 hour period indefinitely. Each time an auction is settled, the settlement transaction will result in the minting and auction of a new noun by the contract. While settlement is most heavily incentivized for the winning bidder, it can be triggered by anyone, allowing the system to trustlessly auction nouns as long as there are interested participants.</p>
    <p>While the auction duration is roughly 24-hours, bids within the final 5 minutes will reset the countdown timer 5 minutes. Extensions can go on indefinitely until no bids are placed within the last 5 minutes of an auction.</p>

    <h2>DAO</h2>
    <p>NounsDAO will be based on the Compound Governance suite of smart contracts.</p>

    <h2>Generative and On-Chain</h2>
    <h2>Public Domain</h2>
    <h2>Nounders and Nounders Reward</h2>
