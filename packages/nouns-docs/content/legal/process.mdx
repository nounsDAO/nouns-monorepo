Below is an outline of the current compliance process to help you better understand what to expect as a grantee. We are always looking for ways to improve our compliance processes. If you have questions or suggestions, please reach out to the DUNA Admins.

## Process Overview

### 1. Proposal Submission
A proposal is submitted onchain via the Nouns governance smart contract.

### 2. Initial Review
DAO compliance admins review the proposal for legal or regulatory risks. If needed, external legal and tax advisors are consulted. If an issue is identified, the DAO is notified and veto admins may be invoked.

### 3. KYC & Tax Collection Outreach
During the voting period, the recipient(s) are contacted with instructions to complete **Know Your Customer (KYC)** or **Know Your Business (KYB)** verification and submit required tax documents via [**Persona**](http://withpersona.com).

### 4. Submission Review
Submitted documents are reviewed for accuracy and completeness. If accepted by Persona, the submission is approved internally.

### 5. Onchain Signal
If it is determined there are no legal or compliance issues and all documentation is satisfactory, an onchain compliance signal is submitted confirming the proposal meets all required criteria.

## Current Limitations

### No Onchain Enforcement
There is currently no mechanism for admins to delay or halt disbursements due to KYC noncompliance. Enforcement depends entirely on manual intervention before proposal execution.

### Withholding Liability
If funds are sent to a noncompliant recipient, the DAO may be liable for up to **~24% in U.S. backup withholding** on the full amount distributed.

### Potential Improvement Path
Implementing an administrative “hold” mechanism between proposal approval and execution could enable compliant disbursement. However, this would require a protocol-level change with associated development and audit costs. Community input and consensus would be needed to prioritize this upgrade.
