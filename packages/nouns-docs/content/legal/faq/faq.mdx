### KYC

**Why is KYC required for proposers and grantees?**  
To comply with U.S. and international financial regulations, ensure funds are sent to legitimate recipients, and reduce risks of fraud.

**What information is required?**
- Full legal name  
- Government-issued ID  
- Date of birth  
- Tax identification forms (W-9, W-8BEN, or W-8BEN-E)   

**Who handles KYC verification?**  
We use [Persona](http://withpersona.com), a trusted third-party provider specializing in secure, privacy-compliant identity verification.

**Is my personal data safe?**  
Yes. Persona maintains compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other global data protection standards.

**What happens if I refuse KYC?**  
Refusing KYC will result in the proposal being flagged as noncompliant. The DAO will be notified and future participation may be discouraged or prevented.

**Does everyone in the DAO need to complete KYC?**  
No. Only grant recipients must complete KYC. Voters, delegates, and DAO members do not need to submit tax info unless requesting a grant.

**Are retroactive grants included?**  
Yes. All future disbursements, including retroactive payments, require KYC.

### Tax & Compliance

**Do I owe taxes on DAO income?**  
Yes. Grants are generally considered taxable income. You are responsible for reporting and paying taxes according to your jurisdiction.

**Will I receive a tax form?**
- U.S. recipients: A 1099 form will be issued where applicable.  
- International recipients: Forms vary depending on local tax laws and W-8BEN/E documentation.

**How do I report this income?**  
Treat it as self-employment, freelance, independent contractor income, etc. It is highly recommended that you consult a tax advisor for personalized guidance.

**Will the DAO withhold taxes?**  
Not automatically. If a recipient fails to provide tax documentation, the DAO may be required to withhold 24% under IRS backup withholding rules.

**Do international grantees need to comply with U.S. tax rules?**  
You must comply with local laws, but since Nouns DAO is a U.S.-based legal entity (Wyoming DUNA), you may also have U.S. tax obligations such as treaty compliance or withholding.

**What are the consequences of non-reporting?**  
Failure to report may result in penalties, audits, or legal consequences, especially as global enforcement on crypto income tightens.
