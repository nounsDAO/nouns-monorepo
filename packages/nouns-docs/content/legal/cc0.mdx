The term CC0 refers to the Creative Commons Zero public-domain dedication - a legal tool that allows creators to waive all rights under copyright law so that others can freely use, remix, and build upon the work.

## What CC0 Means in Plain Terms

When something is released under CC0:

- It is as close to the public domain as legally possible.
- Anyone can copy, modify, distribute, or commercially use the work without asking permission or paying royalties.
- The original creator retains no exclusive rights that prevent others from acting on the work.

## Why It Matters for the Nouns Ecosystem

Nouns DAO adopted CC0 for its IP - the artwork, technical stack, and brand identity tied to the Nouns collection. This means:

- The artwork is in the public domain and free for anyone to reuse, remix, brand, or commercialize.
- Builders, artists, entrepreneurs and community members are empowered to extend the ecosystem without licensing friction.
- The model supports an open, decentralized growth mindset: by removing IP barriers, more creative derivatives and brand extensions become possible.

## Practical Implications

With the CC0 status of Nouns, here’s what’s enabled:

- Free commercial use: projects can use Nouns imagery in products, services, merchandise, marketing or whatever they choose.
- Remixing and derivatives: creators can take the base NFTs, modify them, combine them, extend them into new artwork or applications.
- Brand extensions: community-driven brands can adopt Nouns characters (or motifs) to launch physical goods, digital experiences, real-world activations.
- Ecosystem growth: since reuse is free and encouraged, cultural proliferation can drive awareness, network effect and new collaborations.
