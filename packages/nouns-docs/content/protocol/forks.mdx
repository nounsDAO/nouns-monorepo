# Nouns DAO Fork Mechanism

The Nouns Fork feature, introduced in the V3 governance upgrade, provides a formal mechanism for groups of token holders to exit and form a new DAO. It is designed as a minority protection tool, allowing token holders to fork the DAO and take a proportional share of assets.   

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of [proposal 662](https://nouns.wtf/vote/662) the fork was disabled by setting the threshold to 100% of the total supply as a compliance requirement for the establishment of the Nouns DUNA. A new [Stream-based minority protection mechanism](https://nouns.wtf/vote/653) was proposed but has not been implemented


## üîç What Is a Fork?

- Forking allows a subset of holders to exit the current DAO together.
- When the fork threshold is reached, a new DAO is created.
- Assets including treasury funds, ETH, ERC-20 tokens, and forking Nouns are transferred proportionally to participants.  

## How Forking Works

### Escrow Period
- Any holder may deposit Nouns into a fork escrow contract.
- Escrowing holders may include a proposal ID and a short reason for forking.
- Withdrawals are permitted during the escrow period, up until finalization.
- Tokens in escrow cannot be used to vote or propose.
- If the forking threadshold is met (% of total supply of Nouns holders escrow their Nouns to fork), the fork can be initiated

### Forking Period
- This period lasts several days
- During this time, no original DAO proposals may be executed, preventing race conditions.  
- Additional holders may still deposit to join the fork.
- Once initiated, the fork cannot be canceled.

### New DAO Creation
- The fork is executed and a new Nouns DAO instance is deployed.
- Participating holders receive new tokens with the same IDs and art as their original Nouns.  
- Treasury assets are transferred proportionally.
- Governance in the new DAO defaults to V1 style: no dynamic quorum, no voting gas refunds, and no vetoer is set.
- Simple ragequit is enabled, allowing individual token holders to leave at any time.
