A **Noun** is an onchain generative NFT that functions both as a digital collectible and a membership token within the Nouns DAO ecosystem. Owning a Noun grants governance rights within the DAO.

## The Art

Each Noun is a 32 × 32 pixel avatar, stored fully on the Ethereum blockchain (not merely a link to off-chain storage). Traits are algorithmically generated and include background, head, body, accessory and glasses (also known as “noggles”). 

The art is open-source under a [CC0 license](/legal/cc0) (public domain), meaning anyone may reuse, remix or build upon the imagery.

## Daily Auctions

A distinctive feature of Nouns DAO is that **one Noun is minted and auctioned every 24 hours, forever**. 100% of auction proceeds flow into the DAO’s treasury, supporting ecosystem growth and public-goods initiatives. Read more about the [Auction Mechanics](/governance/auctions).

## DAO Membership

By owning a Noun you automatically become a member of Nouns DAO. Each Noun grants one vote in governance. There is no hard cap on how many Nouns an individual may hold, and voting power scales proportionately with holdings (1 Noun = 1 vote).

- Holding a Noun grants membership and governance rights within Nouns DAO.
- The Noun art and brand are CC0 - free to use, build upon and extend.
- This model is distinct in the NFT/DAO space because it integrates identity, funding and governance with a perpetual cadence and open IP.
